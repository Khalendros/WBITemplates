	description = Designed to keep the crew from losing screws during production, the Steam Whistle Centriforge allows organizations to process ore completely to Rocket Parts. It does require an active mining operation to keep up production, but when coupled with a drydock, the Steam Whistle Centriforge can help establish a foothold anywhere.
