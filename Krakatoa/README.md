Various unofficial templates as I create them to fill a need.

Thank you for taking a look at this template for Wild Blue Industries' DSEV Centrifuge!
Placing this config anywhere in your GameData folder will allow Module Manager to find it and add it to your choices.
It's suggested that you create a folder for your personal MM patches so that they don't get deleted when updating other mods.
Once it is in your GameData folder, just load up the game and place a Centrifuge.
The Steam Whistle Centriforge will appear as a choice in the Manage Operations menu.
It's currently balanced to be a little less than half the speed at its various tasks than the Bigby Orbital Workshop and about 25%
better than the Ironworks foundry, as access to the Steam Whistle doesn't become available until you have unlocked the Nanolathing
node in the Community Tech Tree.
