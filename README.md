# WBITemplates
Various unofficial templates as I create them to fill a need.
The information below will be filled in as I add more pieces to the ReadMe

//For DSEV Centrifuge Templates

Thank you for taking a look at this template for Wild Blue Industries' DSEV Centrifuge!
Placing this config anywhere in your GameData folder will allow Module Manager to find it and add it to your choices.
It's suggested that you create a folder for your personal MM patches so that they don't get deleted when updating other mods.
Once it is in your GameData folder, just load up the game and place a Centrifuge.
The Steam Whistle Centriforge will appear as a choice in the Manage Operations menu.
It's currently balanced to be a little less than half the speed at its various tasks than the Bigby Orbital Workshop and about 25%
better than the Ironworks foundry, as access to the Steam Whistle doesn't become available until you have unlocked the Nanolathing
node in the Community Tech Tree.


//For Storage Templates

Place each template you need anywhere in your GameData folder and it will work. Each is named with the resource it adds to your options on WBI's containers.


//For Contract Fixes

These work the same as other MM patches, just take the file and place it anywhere in your GameData folder, preferrably in a folder for your personal patches outside of any mods.  This patch currently fixes a bug where the Compact ISRU from WBI's DSEV mod wasn't being counted for contracts requiring a base or station to have an ISRU onboard.
